# 📡 Launch Timing & Meta Reading

## ⏰ When to Buy
- **First 5 minutes after launch**  
  🔥 High risk, high reward. Best entries if you're early and fast — but most volatile.

- **Final Stretch**  
  ✅ Safer entry point. There's visible momentum, early holders are established, and volume is picking up.

- **Migrated**  
  🐢 Slower plays, but stronger conviction. Coins that migrated to PumpSwap are now eligible for listings and longer lifespan.

## 📈 How to Read the Meta (a.k.a. Know What's Hot)
The memecoin game moves at the speed of internet culture. Here's how to spot what's about to run:

- 🧵 **Twitter Engagement**  
  High likes, comments, reposts = incoming pump.

- 👑 **Top Wallet Entries**  
  Is a known wallet aping in? Use GMGN or Axiom to check.

- 🤖 **Pump.fun Leaderboard**  
  See what's trending in real time. Leaderboard coins often attract fresh volume.

- 🗞 **Real-World Connection**  
  Does the meme reference something going viral? (e.g., presidential news, trending video, AI jokes, celebrity blunders)

- 🚀 **Big Names Mentioned It?**  
  Did Elon, Trump, or other major figures tweet or meme it — even indirectly? That alone can send a coin flying.

- 😂 **Is It Funny?**  
  Simple rule: if it makes people laugh, it's more likely to run. The funniest, dumbest memes often perform the best. 


**HOW TO SEE BUNDLES**

## What is a "Bundle"?
A bundle is when token devs use multiple wallets to buy large portions of a coin at launch—often in the same transaction or within milliseconds. The goal is to block snipers and secure supply early. While sometimes used for protection, it's often abused by devs to manipulate the launch.

💊 **Brief History**
Early bundles meant buying a token with multiple wallets during creation. These were easy to spot via UI or trading tools. As detection improved, devs evolved—now using "mass snipes" where several wallets buy in the same block/slot (within ~0.4 seconds), making it harder to detect.

🤖 **What TrenchRadar Does**
TrenchRadar scans pump.fun transactions and highlights suspicious buys (⚠️). It groups buys in the same slot, checks if wallets still hold the token, and how much they hold—making detection faster and clearer for you.

⚠️ **Important Notes**
- 2 wallets buying at once = not a big deal.
- 3+ wallets holding large % = red flag.
- Sometimes multiple buys in one slot happen naturally (copytrading bots, multi-wallet tools).
- But if 24 wallets buy in 0.4s and hold 76%—it's clearly a manipulated bundle.

As you can see, this is a clearly bundled scam coin.
