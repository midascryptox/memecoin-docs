# 📡 Launch Timing & Meta Reading

## ⏰ When to Buy
- **First 5 minutes after launch**  
  🔥 High risk, high reward. Best entries if you're early and fast — but most volatile.

- **Final Stretch**  
  ✅ Safer entry point. There's visible momentum, early holders are established, and volume is picking up.

- **Migrated**  
  🐢 Slower plays, but stronger conviction. Coins that migrated to PumpSwap are now eligible for listings and longer lifespan.

## 📈 How to Read the Meta (a.k.a. Know What's Hot)
The memecoin game moves at the speed of internet culture. Here's how to spot what's about to run:

- 🧵 **Twitter Engagement**  
  High likes, comments, reposts = incoming pump.

- 👑 **Top Wallet Entries**  
  Is a known wallet aping in? Use GMGN or Axiom to check.

- 🤖 **Pump.fun Leaderboard**  
  See what's trending in real time. Leaderboard coins often attract fresh volume.

- 🗞 **Real-World Connection**  
  Does the meme reference something going viral? (e.g., presidential news, trending video, AI jokes, celebrity blunders)

- 🚀 **Big Names Mentioned It?**  
  Did Elon, Trump, or other major figures tweet or meme it — even indirectly? That alone can send a coin flying.

- 😂 **Is It Funny?**  
  Simple rule: if it makes people laugh, it's more likely to run. The funniest, dumbest memes often perform the best.
