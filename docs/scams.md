# 🚨 Avoiding Scams

The memecoin space is wild, but you can protect yourself by learning to spot red flags early. Use this checklist to avoid rugs, honeypots, and fake hype.

## 🔒 Smart Contract Safety Checklist
Before you ape into any coin, check for these safety markers:

- ✅ **LP Burnt / LP Locked** – Liquidity is either permanently burned or locked in a contract.
- ✅ **Mint Authority Revoked** – Dev can't mint more tokens out of nowhere.
- ✅ **Freeze Authority Disabled** – Can't freeze wallets.
- 🚫 **No Bundles** – Tokens bundled with fake value can trap you.
- 🚫 **No Fresh Accounts in Top Holders** – Avoid coins where the top wallets are all just-created wallets.
- 📉 **Low Top Holder %** – Healthy distribution = less chance of a dump.
- 🔍 **Check Socials** – Active Twitter, Telegram, or Discord? Real engagement?
- 🚫 **No Presales** – Presales can lead to insider dumps.
- 📵 **No Reused Twitter Handles** – Lazy devs recycle Twitters — check username history.
- 🧑‍💻 **Dev History Clean** – Use tools like SolanaFM to check wallet history. No previous rugs? Safer bet.

## 🧠 Golden Rules of Staying Safe in Crypto
1️⃣ Never click shady links — even if they look official.
2️⃣ Never connect your wallet to unknown or suspicious sites.
3️⃣ Never trust random DMs or Discord invites.
4️⃣ Never share your seed phrase or private key — not even with your cat.

## 🛡 Browser Security Tip
Install trusted browser extensions like:
